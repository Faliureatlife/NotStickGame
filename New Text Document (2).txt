4/11
I finished the script for making collision work
Changing the value checked to hexadecimal
Forgetting how color values work
not much i just did clerical work
Work on adding dialog in

3/30
Begin work for adding dialog
not much i was just fixing what jacob broke
commiting the compiler files
dont commit the files it says not to commit


3/29
make the collision gen start working and find out why pond, library and school dont work
borrowing and printing tests
scaling them wrong
need to double check more times
fix at home

3/28
write collision gen
loop and check values
didnt test yet
it may be easy it may not be
testing and fix

3/16
3/15
3/14

3/13
small fixes on the draw function
changing out the entities values
using references that don't exist
gotta be very careful with methods
add in these references

3/10
add in positings and change a bunch of stuff
math for iterating
dedicated player sprite iterator
math is good sometimes
keep working on it

3/9
start minor rewrite of draw function
grouping the data together
notihng this time
lots of small changes needed
continue rework

3/8
Update the data.json files
adding all the interact values
not having the values for initialization
must be veryt careful about what is continued
make draw function improvements

3/7
working movement and update build settings
more linking and codegen
the old settings
easy to change
smooth interact function

3/3
add in the function and beign coding
new screen function
using vec<[u16]>
data types finicky
fill out details of function

2/3
begin work on the interaction between character and environment
adding in parameters and values
nothing this time
this is not bad
continuing implementing

1/3
Add in paths for new screens
downloading pngs
colors.py
its weird
fix forreal

28/2
Work on rewriting entities
comparing scroll + xpos wit entity xpos
the way i did it on the player
math
making it not immediately error out 

16/2
Finish moving across screens
trial and error
the earlier trials and the errors
serde took a really long time to compile, also edge cases are important
changing size of character

15/2
Change movement speed
using constants
Not using constants
i need to add in player size constants to stop having to do math
add in said constants

14/2
Debugging movement of screens
not being dumb
the original implementation
idk
continue working

9/2
Work on adding functionality for moving screens
changing json files to have values to find where to
reading the values from inside move functions
types are hard
adding in values to struct containing the places that can be moved to
S
8/2
change .unwrap to .expect
copy and pasting it all
nothing
this was probably a waste of time
implement moving screens

7/2
Fix read from json
use a function that handles the value returned when extracting json
trying to return a Value
reading the documentation is helpful
changing unwrap to expect

1/3
add in function to get
using function instead of single line
using as value 
have to change value for return/param
implementing that maybe

1/2
add in serde support to json data files
adding in to parameters
nothing yet
json is annoying
fix bugs

31/1

30/1
Add in animations while it scrolls
Moving the movement animation check to runner function
Failing to copy the data properly
This was easier than I thought it would be

25/1
Work on saving data to check function
Not anything this time
writing to file
Need to read some more into Vec type
Finding out how to make a vector implement ref[u8]

10/1
Made fixed point-based collision
using a vector chunked into two to represent x and y
using the wrong < and > signs
this was a lot easier than i thought it would be
rendering multiple entities

13/12
Fixed the dumps
formatting the text to be readable 

12/12
add in data dump file
writing to file as .txt
writing it as normal text file
Doesnt play nice sometimes
figure out whats happening

8/12
marked where render rwdoing will happen
think about what i'll need to do
nothing to really break
im doing this really poorly
actually put the code in

7/12
I fixed the movement
using key_pressed_os
using key_held or key_pressed
read the docs more if things dont work
movement animation?

6/12

5/12
30/11 
Added functionality for parrallel iterators
replacing for with each in iter
into_iter()
rayon seems to be useful
replace the continue to next_iter

10/11
listen to presentation
take notes of what she said
//
man opportunities in the esports area for students
tomorrows presentation

4/11
Got rid of parseinterror for out of bounds error

2/11
I fixed some of the errors
reading errors and tracking what causes them via clippy
My code
I need to do a lot of error chasing at home
fix more errors

1/11
Added implementations for screen
taking inspiration from others code
trying to make hardcoded stuff
break up the program 
bugfix

31/10
clean up render function
checking the types of data
telling the program what to do
More work with control flow has to be done to finish implementation
Making the picture draw properly 

25/10
try to use slices for adding things in


21/10
Add comments to code
Splitting things into sections to remember
not having comments
Good coding processes are good
Add more things 
19/10
Work on rendering 
reading more docs
functions
Its going to be really hard to have a working demo done on time
implement some form of rendering to screen

17/10
try to fix compiler error
nothing so far
restarting and closing programs and deleting conflicting files
there is probably something open causing problems
hope that thing isnt open

12/10
Learn to use .run
looking at documentation for control flow
my own solutions
the internet is good and use the dcumentation as a starting point
implementing more than closing the window

11/10
trying to use .run
trial and error

7/10

google
Use the errors to help you
